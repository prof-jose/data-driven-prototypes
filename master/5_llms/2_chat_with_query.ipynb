Let's take a look.\\n\\nCristian Trujillo/Quality Sport Images/Getty Images\\n\\nWe know Barcelona like to keep it in the family.\\n\\nEven before Xavi's decision to step down was public, club legend Rafael Marquez was being touted as the most likely candidate to replace him.\\n\\nIt's an easy link that makes sense\\u2013the Mexican has been coach of Barcelona B since 2022\\u2013but it's difficult to see what potential he could squeeze out of the team that Xavi couldn't.\\n\\nFirstly, Barcelona should be targeting a more experienced coach once Xavi leaves. Marquez spent just a few months with Alcal\\u00e1 under-15s side before a lengthy break eventually led to him getting the nod with Barca's reserves.\\n\\nThe 45-year-old has never taken charge of a top-level professional match. It doesn't really matter that he was a tough leader on the pitch, managing a club with Barcelona's expectations would test even the most established coaches.\\n\\nMarquez is probably the cheapest appointment for Joan Laporta, who continues to oversee dire finances, but the president is asking too much to repeat the magic of Pep Guardiola's evolution as a coach.\\n\\nDoes Barca really need a less experienced coach than it already had? One who plays similar football to the person leaving? No, they don't.\\n\\nJ\\u00fcrgen Fromme - firo sportphoto/Getty Images\\n\\nIt's staggering to think Hansi Flick became the first Germany national coach in history to be sacked.\\n\\nDie Mannschaft's 4-1 humbling at the hands of Japan in September was the final straw of a dismal tenure that included elimination from the 2022 World Cup at the group stage. Just 12 wins in 25 matches is at odds with what he achieved at Bayern Munich, though.\\n\\nFlick mopped up seven trophies in two years with Bayern, including a Champions League final win over Paris Saint-Germain. He's calm under pressure, smart and a clear communicator of instructions. He doesn't currently speak Spanish, though. German paper Bild, via AS, suggests he is in the process of learning in case the opportunity arises.\\n\\nBeing able to communicate properly is obviously important. Flick does have Barca attributes in his coaching philosophy\\u2014he likes to dictate play with centre-backs controlling the ball, for example\\u2014but remove the precision of his communication, and frustration may quickly set in.\\n\\nThere's also the sense the 58-year-old needs to succeed in another job without the, ahem, almost-guaranteed success of Bayern before stepping back into such a huge role.\\n\\nBurak Akbulut/Anadolu via Getty Images\\n\\nBarcelona DNA? Check. Tactically astute? Check. Promoted with a smaller club and then impressing in La Liga? Check. Garcia Pimienta isn't as sexy a name as someone like Rafa Marquez if Barca insist on sticking with managers forged in their identity, but he might just be the most interesting appointment of that type.\\n\\nThe 49-year-old has an incredible amount of coaching experience at Barca, having worked in various youth ranks from 2006 until being let go in 2021. This time included a UEFA Youth League win and getting Barcelona B to the play-offs twice. He now, vitally, has senior managerial experience to point to as well.\\n\\nLas Palmas sit 10th in La Liga with 10 wins, five draws and 10 losses, including a goal difference of zero. Entirely mid-table is a huge achievement at this point; they are completely safe and looking up rather than down.\\n\\nIt recently took Real Madrid until the 84th minute to score their winner in a 2-1 victory against Las Palmas, with Barcelona needing a 93rd-minute penalty to do the same. This season has included wins over Atletico Madrid, Villarreal and Valencia.\\n\\nIt won't be long until someone bigger gives Pimienta a chance, whether Barca go for him or not.\\n\\nStuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC via Getty Images\\n\\nTo be clear, I don't think Mikel Arteta is likely to join Barcelona in the summer. I do, however, think he'd be an excellent pick if he ever became available. He is someone who could freshen up the club without totally dismantling its identity.\\n\\nArteta, 41, has found an excellent style of play at Arsenal that combines control and directness to an often devastating effect. He trusts his players into forward-thinking possession; holding the ball is important, but so is moving up the pitch at speed. He's a strict tactician who improves most players he works with. Years spent as Guardiola's assistant at Manchester City certainly weren't wasted.\\n\\nFew would have expected the former Everton midfielder to push the Gunners to title contention last season. Even fewer would have expected him to replicate it this year.\\n\\nIt's impossible not to be impressed by a manager who maintains authority while playing entertaining, goalscoring football. Arsenal would be remiss to let him go, though.\\n\\nMatt McNulty/Getty Images\\n\\nRoberto De Zerbi is one of the most exciting young coaches in the world. He's a man who will be linked with Europe's elite clubs whenever there's a managerial vacancy to fill.\\n\\nHis Brighton & Hove Albion side have built on the excellent work of Graham Potter and become one of England's most entertaining sides by playing fast-paced, aggressive attacking football against opponents that often can't keep up.\\n\\nThe next Barca coach will need time on what is essentially a project of rebuilding without major resources. De Zerbi is used to working with a modest budget by Premier League standards and is even more used to seeing his star players plucked for sums too good to turn down. He always finds a solution.\\n\\nVitally, the 44-year-old also knows how to speak Spanish and he's used to giving young players important roles in his team. The likes of Jo\\u00e3o Pedro, Julio Enciso, Simon Adingra, Billy Gilmour and Jack Hinshelwood have strode forwards with confidence under his tutelage. Even Barca loanee Ansu Fati looked like he was regaining his swagger before injury slowed his momentum.\\n\\nBarca often make managerial signings that Europe's other biggest clubs wouldn't look at, so for once, it would be beneficial to try to act decisively ahead of the pack.\\n\\nHiring someone of De Zerbi's profile would be the start of a very exciting era.\",\n",

Xavi Hern\\u00e1ndez, a youth team product at Bar\\u00e7a, has left his current club, Al-Sadd of Qatar, after talks held over the last few days with the owners of the club.\\n\\nIt is expected that Xavi Hern\\u00e1ndez will arrive in Barcelona this weekend and that on Monday 8 November his presentation as new FC Barcelona first team coach will take place in an event open to the public at Camp Nou. After the event Xavi Hern\\u00e1ndez will appear in a press conference in the Ricard Maxenchs press room.\\n\\nShortly we will detail the agenda for the presentation of Xavi Hern\\u00e1ndez as the new coach of the first team.\\n\\nWant to see Xavi's Bar\\u00e7a?\\n\\nWin two tickets to see the new coach's Bar\\u00e7a team in action\\n\\nBar\\u00e7a legend: 767 games and 25 titles\\n\\nXavi is an absolute legend at FC Barcelona. His 767 appearances for the senior team were a record until he was surpassed recently by Leo Messi (778). In his 17 years in the first team (1998 to 2015), he won 25 major trophies:\\n\\nLiga: 8 (1998/99, 2004/05, 2005/06, 2008/09, 2009/10, 2010/11, 2012/13 & 2014/15) Champions League: 4 (2005/06, 2008/09, 2010/11 & 2014/15) Copa del Rey: 3 (2008/09, 2011/12 & 2014/15) Club World Cup: 2 (2009/10 & 2011/12) European Super Cups: 2 (2009/10 & 2011/12) Spanish Super Cups: 6 (2005/06, 2006/07, 2009/10, 2010/11, 2011/12 & 2013/14).\\n\\nGet ready for Xavi's return\\n\\nDress like a true culer to welcome the new coach\\n\\nHowever, in total he was at the club for 24 years, beginning as an U12 in 1991/92. One of the greatest midfield maestros of all time, he helped redefine the art with his creative mind, pinpoint passing and sublime ability to read the game. The utter brains of the team, he made up for his lack of physical might with extraordinary wits, superb skills and an extraordinary talent for governing everything that went on in the middle of the park.\\n\\nXavi Hern\\u00e1ndez top videos\\n\\nGoals, assists and skills from the FC Barcelona legend!\\n\\nLouis van Gaal gave Xavi his first team debut in 1998, and he immediately secured a regular place in the starting XI. It was under Frank Rijkaard from 2003 that he truly exploded, and under Pep Guardiola from 2008 he became regarded as one of the greatest players ever to grace the game.\\n\\nAfter Carles Puyol retired, he assumed the captaincy, and eventually departed the club in 2015. Six years later, and he is back, this time as coach, where some of his charges are former playing colleagues: Sergio Busquets, Gerard Piqu\\u00e9, Sergi Roberto, Jordi Alba and Ter Stegen.\\n\\nXavi played out the final years of his career at Al-Sadd in Qatar, and after hanging up his boots in 2019, he became the team coach. He\\u2019d only been in the position for a few months when he won the Qatari Super Cup, and also led the team to the semi-finals of the AFC Champions League.\\n\\nIn total, he coached the team to seven different trophies, three of them in 2021.\\n\\nRelated to this article\\n\\nUEFA Champions League 5 Trophies\\n\\nFIFA Club World Cup 3 Trophies\\n\\nCopa Del Rey 31 Trophies\\n\\nFollow FC Barcelona on social media\\n\\nRelated to this article\",\n",
